**Is the solution complete?**

[Yes/No]
No

**Did you run into any problems?**

[Describe...]
Syntax errors when working with Bootstrap. I placed certain code blocks in the wrong div, or I was using the wrong classes when trying to offset my images. Also, I attempted to change the background color of the html. I am using a mac, and when I hover over the miniturized preview of the file, the background color is there, but when I actually open the file it is not. I can't say why.
**Did you collaborate with others on this solution?**
No
